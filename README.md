# Understanding Hospital Readmissions Due to Diabetes

## Project Overview

This project analyzes hospital readmissions due to diabetes in the U.S. between 1999 and 2008. Diabetes is a chronic condition marked by high blood sugar levels, and frequent readmissions may signal gaps in care.
The analysis explores patterns across age, gender, race, diagnoses, and medications to understand what factors contribute to early readmission. Insights from this project can help healthcare providers improve diabetes management and reduce preventable readmissions.
